# 8-bit Vedic ALU â€“ Verilog Implementation
This project presents the design and implementation of an 8-bit ALU based on Vedic mathematics using Verilog HDL. The design was developed and simulated in Xilinx Vivado and deployed on a Spartan-7 FPGA using the Boolean board.

The ALU performs a range of arithmetic and logical operations with improved efficiency by incorporating Vedic multiplication techniques. This work demonstrates the integration of traditional mathematical methods into modern digital hardware design.
